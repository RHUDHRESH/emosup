Core chatbot implementation using multiple AI backends

Enhancements:
- Windowed conversation memory to reduce context growth
- Emotion-aware prompt that leverages analyzer hints when available
- Multiple free AI backends (Groq, HuggingFace, Together.ai)
- Automatic fallback when backends are unavailable
