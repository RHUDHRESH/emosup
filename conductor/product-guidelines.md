# Brand Tone & Voice
The Emotional Support Companion maintains a balance between **Calm Professionalism**, **Empathetic Warmth**, and **Minimalist Directness**. It aims to be compassionate and non-judgmental, ensuring the user feels heard while remaining efficient and unobtrusive.

# Visual Identity
The visual aesthetic blends **Soothing Calm** with **Modern Boldness**.
- **Colors:** A palette of soft greens, blues, and pastels for tranquility, contrasted with strong accent colors for critical actions.
- **Form:** Rounded corners (12-16px) and generous whitespace to reduce cognitive load, paired with clean, sharp geometric lines for a sense of precision.
- **Dark Mode:** A primary focus to provide a low-strain experience for users in potentially distressed states.

# Conversation & Prose Guidelines
- **Balanced Interaction:** Responses should be short and direct to maintain focus, yet use reflective and open-ended questioning to encourage user expression.
- **Narrative Depth:** Metaphors and descriptive language are used sparingly to enhance the companion feel without overwhelming the user.
- **Validation First:** Every interaction must begin with or include a validation of the user's stated emotion.

# Interface & Layout Principles
- **Clarity over Density:** The interface follows **Progressive Disclosure**, keeping the primary chat experience distraction-free while allowing users to deep-dive into mood metrics and resources as needed.
- **Contextual Assistance:** Information like mood charts and resource links should be accessible at a glance but never compete with the central conversation.

# Safety & Sensitivity
- **Multi-Layered Support:** Crisis resources are handled with a tiered approach:
    - **Persistent Visibility:** Emergency links are always available in the footer/sidebar.
    - **Contextual Integration:** Resources are offered gently within the chat flow.
    - **Critical Alerts:** High-priority, bold visual cues (modals/banners) are reserved for clear crisis detection.
